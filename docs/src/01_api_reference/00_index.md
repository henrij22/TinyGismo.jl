## Overview

TinyGismo.jl provides a Julia interface to the G+Smo (Geometry + Simulation Modules) library, focusing on:

- **Knot Vectors**: Management of knot sequences that define spline spaces
- **Basis Functions**: B-spline and NURBS basis functions in univariate and tensor product forms
- **Geometries**: Spline curves, surfaces, and volumes for geometric modeling
- **Factories**: Convenient constructors for standard geometric shapes
- **Utilities**: Matrix types, file I/O, and helper functions
